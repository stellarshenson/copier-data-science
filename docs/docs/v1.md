# Upstream Template v1

> [!NOTE]
> This document describes the original Cookiecutter Data Science v1 template from DrivenData. See the [upstream documentation](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/v1/) for details.

While v1 has been deprecated and we recommend using the current version moving forward, you can still use the v1 template from the upstream repository.

## Requirements

 - Python 3.8+
 - [cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: `pip install cookiecutter`

## Starting a new project
