Project structure and reproducibility is talked about more in the R research community. Here are some projects and blog posts if you're working in R that may help you out.

 - [Project Template](https://projecttemplate.net/index.html) - An R data analysis template
 - "[Designing projects](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)" on Nice R Code
 - "[My research workflow](https://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html)" on Carlboettiger.info
 - "[A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)" in PLOS Computational Biology

Thanks to the [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) project for enabling template updates for existing projects, and to the original [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) project which inspired this template structure.
